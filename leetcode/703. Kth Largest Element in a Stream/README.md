Difficulty: **Easy**

Feels like: **Easy**

Language: **Python3**

## Problem description

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

- KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.

- int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

## Solution idea



## Complexity

### Time

The slowest part is initialization, because the array is first sorted and then only *k* elements left

### Memory
